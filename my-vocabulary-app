Discover the Power of Words with Our Vocabulary App

 In this global world, the awareness of the power of words and their mastery is making themselves more vital than before. Being able to communicate is an essential part of day-to-day life. Words are the tools we use to express ourselves during our conversation; they are the vessels that carry our message and connect us to the other person. Being multilingual influences part of your growth as a person. Having an assortment of words also helps people becoming the knowledge you have already acquired over the years giving you the possibility to speak more, and at the same time learning how to communicate better. That is why we at NationVox decided to create this educational and engaging Vocabulary App that helps users of any age learn new words and expand their vocabulary.

Purpose of the Project

 Our Vocabulary App is closely tied to our passion for language, and our commitment to education. The app’s main purpose is to allow you to learn more words, gain insight into how they are defined, and use them in actualised speaking. A good vocabulary is one that allows you speak with intensity and eloquence, any time, any place. The goal is not to have the best, most sophisticated words in any and all circumstances, so long as you are using your words well, and understanding them properly … 

 The app combines active learning techniques – such as games, quizzes, flashcards and challenge walls – with proven, scientific techniques for committing new words to memory and integrating them into real life. Users are able to learn how to learn new words and facts, and become active learners for the first time. The app gives the freedom to learn at a pace that suits the individual. As the user interacts with the app, completing games and quizzes, the app assesses learning styles and progress.

My Journey From Words to Wisdom

 One morning in Lagos, Nigeria I  woke up with a single biggest wish: to become a poet. Seyi, as i was commonly called, had grown up in a multilingual environment and loved words from the onset. I saw how language could transgress barriers, forge connections, and open doors to uncharted territories. With my big wish, Oluwaseyifunmi – a Yoruba name that translates as ‘God has promised to do this for me’ – decided to pursue a career as a poet in English. It’s around this time that many teenagers are overwhelmed by the high expectations from parents, teachers and society at large and develop a sense of futility.

The Inspiration

 My early education was where it started for him. ‘I will never forget my first fascination with words when my grandmother told stories to me in Yoruba when I was small,’ I said, referring to the language spoken throughout Nigeria’s southwestern region. For those with any aspiration of participating in national democracy, speaking at least a working knowledge of English is a must One of the reasons why I had such a broad appreciation of language, however, was due to my interest in the English language. ‘We all knew we needed to be able to communicate in English, the lingua franca, not only to communicate across our diverse communities, but also to access wider worlds of knowledge, ideas, and opportunities.’ Growing up in an educationally aware family, it was my love of language, specifically my fascination for words, that spoiled me for life. More than simply reading and writing, I was motivated to learn new words..

 As I stepped up to middle school, continued on to high school, and then studied at university, I began to notice that many of my peers faced a similar problem: few of them had gone through the process of acquiring a strong vocabulary, which is an essential component for confident, thoughtful communication. Teaching vocabulary, for us as parents, was never simply a lifeless exercise in memory. It was about meaning, context and nuance, not least because words are defined and enriched only through their usage.

The Vision

 Inspired by that idea, I decided to create a tool to help people – both students and non-native speakers – develop the sort of powerful vocabulary which I felt could open up new possibilities for study, work and life. This idea became the Vocabulary App.

The Creation

 Still, software engineering was in my  background so, with a laptop and a dream, I started to try to make this a reality. I taught himself mobile app development on the web through YouTube, React Native and Expo, and then I worked night and day developing an app with engaging and easy-to-use usability. I wanted to make an app.

 I spent several days speaking with teachers, linguists and potential users to find out what they would like to have in such an app. I wanted it to fulfil a primary function similar to a digital dictionary, but I also believed it should function as an educational app that went beyond quizzes and flashcards, working, rather, as a game.


Who Is the Vocabulary App For?

 Our Vocabulary App has been built with a customer diversity in mind, for the needs of different user groups:

 Students: Are you preparing for the SAT/SAT II/PSAT? Are you writing papers for school? Would you like to improve your vocabulary and school performance?

 Professionals: Clear communication is paramount in the professional world, and our app is designed especially for professionals who want to strengthen their language or communication skills so that they can communicate more clearly and ultimately be more persuasive in their messages, whether they are in business, education, healthcare, technology, publishing or other fields. 

 Language Obsessives: For an avid word hound on the constant hunt for fresh new words and expressions, our app offers a treasure trove. For writers, poets, and true lovers of the English language. 

 non-Native SpeakersCan you imagine how hard it must be to learn a new language? Especially for non-native speakers, having a substantial vocabulary is key. However, with our app very clear definitions and a small guide on how to pronounce the new words will greatly decrease the time before practising the word in a simple sentence. 

 All round Useful to Students: Literally a reference book at your fingertips. Tools for writers: Never get stuck for a word again, whether you’re crafting fiction or writing essays. Professional Benefits: Just the facts, ma’am – a valuable resource for those who need to know. Everyday applications: Next time someone says you should ‘de-centralise’, you’ll know whether their cognitive fog has a metaphoric or literal cause. Language Lover: Our app helps you find a place in this great cosmos – surrounded by light and knowledge instead of the darkness and ignorance currently flanking you.

 Reflections on Developing the Vocabulary App

 It’s been fascinating to work on the Vocabulary App as its developer. I’ve learnt more about good technical practice, user-centred design, project management, and quick responses to changing requirements, than I could have by reading any number of books.



 Along this journey, I cultivated my programming skills working with mobile app dev frameworks and languages; precise development practices with React Native and Expo; powers of expert application of an app model for both iOS and Android, and; life-giving gifts of interactive UI such as quizzes and flashcards which bring user experience to life.



 However, in addition to technical considerations, I learned to focus on users and their needs: with a little help from user research and feedback sessions, I was able to progress to designing an app that not only functions well, but is also intuitive, and ultimately, a pleasure to use. Perhaps most importantly, my time at the Academy has taught me the value of iterative development and continuous improvement through user feedback.



 So all in all, I think working on this project taught me a lot about time management and planning. I had to plan everything thoroughly to stay organised between coding, design, and testing, and working towards the deployment of our website.



 In the end, developing the Vocabulary App has been a huge gift to me. It has taught me more about a wide range of skills – and a cathartic understanding of what it takes to turn an idea into something real.

Achievements as the Creator of the Vocabulary App

 Working on the Vocabulary App has been a rewarding experience with milestones I have surpassed that equip me with improved technical skills and are capable of bettering the user experience of many people. Below are turnovers I have achieved on this project:

Technical Mastery

 The Vocabulary App was my first practice project for learning mobile app development. It is now my most extensive personal project on this matter. With React Native and Expo, I constructed a cross-platform mobile app (works on both iOS and Android) that can be used to learn words. I demonstrate proficiency in creating, optimising, and maintaining a mobile app that can offer a desktop-like experience with customised functionalities to serve users various application needs.

User-Centric Design

 I am also very proud of creating an app that is focused on great user experience. Due to a number of user research and feedback sessions, I was able to design an intuitive interface that can be both captivating and user friendly. The educational content was developed with interactivity in mind. Quizzes, games and flashcards are a great way to enchance the learning experience for users of all ages.


Educational Impact

 From that moment, The Vocabulary App was born. It has literally improved people’s language abilities throughout the world. Students, professionals, language enthusiasts, non-native speakers, foreign language teachers. I have heard positive feedback from many who have used it. And it is simply grand and fulfilling to see that the efforts made have improved of words, their communication abilities.

 Project Management Skills

 Working on the Vocabulary App project has greatly improved my project management skills. I had to plan the project at the beginning, make sure that it went on properly and that all necessary tasks like coding, design, testing the system and taking into account users’ suggestions were done just right. Now I am capable of managing even the most complicated projects and complete them on time. 

 Community Engagement

 The app has also resulted in the creation of a community – a bunch of people who have the desire to improve their English skills, and who have been exposed to the original vocabulary from the TV series through this network. People who, through this network, have become acquainted with each other. Creating a community is therefore a major achievement of the Vocabulary App, a value addition aside from the main educational purpose of the app.

 Continuous Improvement

 I put in a system of continuous improvement based on user feedback. The app is updated regulary with changes and improvements in order to have the app up to date, functional and userfriendly. Installing this constant system shows my commitment to developing and improving a quality developed product, while developing together with the users. 



 By the end, I had created a potentially useful product, showcased my programming abilities and design thinking, and made a meaningful difference in the lives of its learned users. Definitely check it out below.
